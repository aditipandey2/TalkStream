The real-time video application project built on the React and Node.js with Socket.io is an interactive platform that allows users to engage in video communication in real-time. 

Here's a breakdown of the components and their functionalities in this project:

React: The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of interactive components, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Node.js: It serves as the backend runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. Node.js enables efficient handling of real-time video communication by leveraging event-driven, non-blocking I/O operations.

Socket.io: Socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients. It establishes a persistent connection between the server and the client, allowing for instant data transmission, such as video streams, messages, and screen sharing.
